## What to do

Let's do some some CSS layout practice!

The above image is a simple website with text and an image. Using whatever CSS technique you'd like, recreate it.

The goal is not to be perfect, but to practice.

## Colors and assets

I'll give you the colors, fonts, and image involved so you don't have to try and look them up yourself.

### Colors

Here are the colors set as [CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*). You don't have to use them as custom properties.

```css
:root {
  --green: #1b390f;
  --red: #de5908;
  --white: #e8d9d6;
}
```

### Fonts

For all text except for the heading I'm using the system sans-serif font. You can use any stack you'd like.

The heading text is using a Google font called [Catamaran](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Catamaran?query=Catamaran) and the weight of `700`. You can import it into your code using this snippet:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Catamaran:wght@700&display=swap">
```

### Image

## Solution

I'll publish a solution soon. Until then, try to re-create this on your own.
